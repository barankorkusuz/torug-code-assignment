# Notes (Optional)

- For all three tasks, I assumed that the inputs provided to the functions are lists.
- Specifically for Task 1, I assumed the `orders` input is a list of dictionary elements.
- For Task 2 and Task 3, I assumed the inputs are lists of primitive types (e.g., strings for emails, numbers/convertible types for measurements).
- These assumptions were made to keep the functions simple and prevent complexity. Further development could involve more robust input validation and handling of nested data structures.
